                    <h1> Transportation system in Latvia </h1>
                    <p>In Riga, public transport services are provided by buses, trams, trolley-buses, and minibuses. Riga public transportation works from around 5 a.m. every morning and up until shortly before midnight. Night buses ply some routes during the nighttime hours on weekends. Rigas satiksme website offers public transport timetables, a map, and a route planner.</p>
                    <p>You may find the following routes useful:</p>

                    <p>Bus No. 22 travels between the Riga Airport and downtown Riga.
                    A trip from the airport to the centre of the city takes approximately 30 minutes. Buses leave every 10 to 30 minutes.</p>

                      <p>Tram No. 11 travels between the centre of Riga and Mezaparks neighbourhood. One trip is 30 minutes. In the summer, the Retro Tram also travels the route – a replica of an electric tram of 1909-1910.
                      Bus No. 1 connects Riga centre and the Open-air Museum. One trip will take 35 minutes.
                      Buying tickets, ticket prices
                      The most convenient way to buy public transport tickets is at Narvesen outlets or at stops equipped with ticket machines – although such machines are not available at all stops. Tickets can also be bought from the driver, but tickets bought this way cost more – EUR 2. We therefore strongly recommend buying your ticket before the trip</p>.

                      <p>There are several ticket types to choose from.</p>

                      <p>Tickets for a certain number of trips:</p>

                      <p>One trip – EUR 1.15
                      Two trips – EUR 2.3
                      Five trips – EUR 5.75
                      Ten trips – EUR 10.9
                      A ticket for one trip is also meant for one boarding – if you have to board another transport to reach your destination, you need to register a new ticket.</p>

                      <p>Time ticket:</p>
                      <pre>
                      24 hours – EUR 5

                      Three days – EUR 10

                      Five days – EUR 15
                      </pre>
                      These tickets can be used for an unlimited number of trips. The countdown starts once the ticket is registered for the first time – or on the first trip.

                      Group tickets:

                      Two trips for two persons – EUR 4.6
                      Two trips for three persons – EUR 6.9
                      Persons with disabilities may ride Riga public transport free of charge, but they have to receive a free ticket from the driver.

                      Passengers may transport bicycles, hand luggage, and pets free of charge, provided that they are transported as hand luggage.

                      A passenger has to register his or her ticket with the electronic validator each time he or she boards a public transport vehicle!

                      Buses
                      Latvia has very good and very regular bus connections, making it is one of the most convenient means of transport for anyone who wants to get to know Latvia’s cities, towns and its vast countryside.

                      Information about buses in Latvia, including timetables, journey times, routes, ticket fares and other information, is available on information boards at the bus station, as well as online in Latvian, Russian, and English, on websites such as Autoosta.lv and 1188.

                      Buying Bus Tickets
                      Tickets for domestic and international routes may be bought at the following places:

                      At ticket desks at the bus station during office hours between 6:00am and 10:00pm;
                      Last minute from the bus driver, although you may find that there are no seats available;
                      At the ticket sales terminal or ticket machine at Riga International Bus Station which operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week;
                      On the website Bezrindas.lv or on international routes - Buseurope.eu.
                      The ticket will display the journey number, time and place of departure and seat number. A paper or SMS ticket should be presented to the driver or inspector, if any, and so it should be kept until the end of the trip!

                      Journey Times
                      There are direct bus routes and buses with stopovers on the way. Some of the most popular tourist destinations may be reached in a few hours:

                      Route	Journey time
                      Riga - Daugavpils	3 to 4 hrs                                    
                      Riga - Ventspils	3 to 4 hrs
                      Riga - Liepaja	3 to 6 hrs
                      Riga - Cesis	1.5 to 2 hrs
                      Useful
                      Large luggage and pet transportation will cost extra. The ticket desk employee or the bus driver should be informed of these items beforehand.

                      Buses do not have toilets, but long routes include a stopover at a bus station with public toilets. New buses on long routes have free wi-fi.

                      In Riga passengers with reduced mobility are guaranteed specially-equipped buses and even companions who should be booked 36hrs before the journey. Outside Riga, the availability of these services should be enquired about at the bus station or with the bus company.

                      Rail
                      Latvia’s rail network system connects the Latvian capital with lines to seven different directions – terminating in Tukums, Liepāja, Daugavpils, Zilupe, Gulbene, Valga and Skulte.

                      The only rail-line which does not go through Riga is the one which connects the towns of Gulbene and Alūksne – the historical narrow-gauge rail-line.

                      Timetables can be found at each station, as well as on-line at Pv.lv and 1188.lv .

                      Average travel time to several popular destinations:

                      Route	Travel time	Ticket price (subject to change)
                      Riga – Sigulda               	1 h 15 min      	2.35 €
                      Riga – Majori (Jurmala)	30 min	1.40 €
                      Riga – Daugavpils	4 h	7.05 €
                      Riga – Cesis	2 h	3.50 €
                      Riga – Liepaja	3 h	7.20 €
                      Rail tickets
                      It is possible to purchase rail tickets at station ticket-offices. If the station ticket office is closed, or the certain station does not have a ticket office, tickets can be purchased inside the train from the onboard conductor. However, if purchasing a ticket onboard, only cash is accepted.

                      Available ticket-types:

                      One-way ticket
                      Return ticket (5% discount on return trip)
                      Extra baggage ticket (necessary for baggage weighing between 20 to 30 kg or oversized baggage between 1.2 to 2 meters, as well as for transporting pets (except dogs) and persons accompanying the visually impaired)
                      Group ticket (available only at ticket offices. Discounts available for groups of 10 and over)
                      Tickets must be presented to onboard conductors and also ticket-inspectors in case of an inspection. This is why tickets must be kept until the end of the journey!

                      Useful information
                      On the Riga-Valga-Riga and Riga-Daugavpils-Riga routes, passengers have the opportunity to travel in comfort class wagons. Comfort class wagons are also available on the Riga-Rēzekne-Riga route, but only on weekends and holidays.

                      Passengers traveling on comfort class wagons can access free WI-FI, choose from a range of magazines to read onboard, as well as sit on comfier seats with tables.
